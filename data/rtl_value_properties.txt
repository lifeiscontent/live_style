# rtl_value_properties.txt
# Properties that have logical values needing RTL transformation
# (float, clear - NOT text-align which browsers handle natively)
#
# StyleX explicitly does NOT transform text-align values because:
# - text-align: start/end are handled natively by browsers based on dir attribute
# - Only float and clear need explicit value transformation
#
# Format: property_name
# One property per line

float
